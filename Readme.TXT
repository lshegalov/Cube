 The project is to confirm a conjecture in topology


Stage 0:
- Each side of cube is selected randomly.
- In the first stage each side is just a square.
- We added two points in the middle of random sides and the line segment between then and 
so we get two polygons instead of one square

Later stages:
Each side of cube is selected randomly.
- Then on that side of the cude a randomly selected polygon is added two new points in the middle of some random sides.
- These two points are connected by the line segment between them
- So we get two polygons instead of one old polygon


The question was the distribution and average of number of sides and vertices in these polygons.
